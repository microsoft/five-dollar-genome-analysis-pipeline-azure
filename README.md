# Cromwell on Azure example workflow
This repository is an example of running the germline alignment and variant calling pipeline, based on [Best Practices Genome Analysis Pipeline by Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/best-practices/workflow?id=11165), on Cromwell on Azure.<br/> 

Learn more about using Azure for your Cromwell WDL workflows on our GitHub repo! - [Cromwell on Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure).<br/>

This repository is a fork from [the original](https://github.com/gatk-workflows/five-dollar-genome-analysis-pipeline) and has all the required changes to run the WDL workflow on Cromwell on Azure.<br/>

Here, you can find the WDL file and an example inputs JSON file with links to data hosted on a public Azure Storage account. You can use the "msgenpublicdata" storage account directly as a relative path, like in the inputs JSON file. 

The `WholeGenomeGermlineSingleSample.hg38.json` trigger file is ready to use. Learn more about how to run the workflow on Cromwell on Azure [here](https://github.com/microsoft/CromwellOnAzure/blob/master/docs/germline-alignment-variantcalling-azure.md).

### Host tutorial data on your Storage account
If you prefer to host this data on your own Storage account, you can use [AzCopy](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azcopy-blobs#copy-a-container-to-another-storage-account) to transfer the entire blob container with the required files to your own Storage account [using a shared access signature](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) with "Write" access.<br/>

```
.\azcopy.exe copy 'https://msgenpublicdata.blob.core.windows.net:443/inputs?sv=2015-04-05&sr=c&si=coa&sig=pENt%2FMMOj24uoNBZIPLa%2BNVVkvopcFK51rwADyYLEPE%3D' 'https://<destination-storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/inputs?<WriteSAS-token>' --recursive --s2s-preserve-access-tier=false
```

Replace all instances of `/msgenpublicdata/inputs/` with your `/destination-storage-account-name/inputs/` in the inputs JSON file.

The `WholeGenomeGermlineSingleSample.hg38.json` trigger file is an example. Substitute the "WorkflowInputsUrl" with the http link to your inputs JSON file hosted on your Storage account.

## five-dollar-genome-analysis-pipeline
Workflows used for germline short variant discovery in WGS data

### germline_single_sample_workflow :
This WDL pipeline implements data pre-processing and initial variant calling (GVCF
generation) according to the GATK Best Practices (June 2016) for germline SNP and
Indel discovery in human whole-genome sequencing data.

#### Requirements/expectations
- Human whole-genome paired-end sequencing data in unmapped BAM (uBAM) format
- One or more read groups, one per uBAM file, all belonging to a single sample (SM)
- Input uBAM files must additionally comply with the following requirements:
    * filenames all have the same suffix (we use ".unmapped.bam")
    * files must pass validation by ValidateSamFile
    * reads are provided in query-sorted order
    * all reads must have an RG tag
- Reference genome must be Hg38 with ALT contigs

#### Outputs 
- Cram, cram index, and cram md5 
- GVCF and its gvcf index 
- BQSR Report
- Several Summary Metrics 

### Software version requirements :
- GATK 4.0.10.1
- Picard 2.16.0-SNAPSHOT
- Samtools 1.3.1
- Python 2.7
- Cromwell version support 
  - Successfully tested on v37
  - Does not work on versions < v23 due to output syntax

### Important Note :
- The provided JSON is meant to be a ready to use example JSON template of the workflow. It is the userâ€™s responsibility to correctly set the reference and resource input variables using the [GATK Tool and Tutorial Documentations](https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/documentation/).
